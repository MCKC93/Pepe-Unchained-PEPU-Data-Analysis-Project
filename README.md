# Pepe-Unchained-PEPU-Data-Analysis-Project

This project explores the price, trading volume, and market capitalization of the cryptocurrency Pepe Unchained (PEPU) to identify patterns and market behaviors. Given that PEPU is a relatively new cryptocurrency, the analysis highlights key insights while acknowledging the limitations due to its short history and limited data.

### Project Objectives
1. Price, Volume, and Market Cap Analysis:
    - Examine the relationships between these key metrics.
    - Identify trends and correlations to better understand market dynamics.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Visualize historical trends in price, volume, and market cap.
    - Analyze the distribution of these variables to uncover insights into market activity.

### Key Findings
- Price vs. Volume: A strong correlation (0.87) suggests that trading activity significantly 
  impacts price movements.
- Market Cap vs. Price: A moderate correlation (0.61) shows alignment between valuation and 
  price trends.
- Market Cap vs. Volume: A weak negative correlation (-0.53) may indicate sporadic trading 
  behavior.
- The cryptocurrency's young age introduces volatility and uncertainty, limiting the 
  reliability of long-term predictions.

### Future Directions
1. On-Chain Metrics: Analyze blockchain data (e.g., transaction volume, active wallets) to 
   understand user adoption and ecosystem growth.
2. Market Behavior Analysis: Study liquidity, order book dynamics, and trading pair performance 
   for deeper insights into market efficiency.
3. Comparative Studies: Compare PEPU with other emerging cryptocurrencies to contextualize its 
   performance and highlight opportunities.
   
### Technologies Used
- Python: Data manipulation and visualization.
