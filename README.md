# Pepe-Unchained-PEPU-Data-Analysis-Project

This project explores the price, trading volume, and market capitalization of the cryptocurrency Pepe Unchained (PEPU) to identify patterns and market behaviors. Given that PEPU is a relatively new cryptocurrency, the analysis highlights key insights while acknowledging the limitations due to its short history and limited data.

**Project Objectives**
Price, Volume, and Market Cap Analysis:

Examine the relationships between these key metrics.
Identify trends and correlations to better understand market dynamics.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Visualize historical trends in price, volume, and market cap.
Analyze the distribution of these variables to uncover insights into market activity.
**Key Findings**
Price vs. Volume: A strong correlation (0.87) suggests that trading activity significantly impacts price movements.
Market Cap vs. Price: A moderate correlation (0.61) shows alignment between valuation and price trends.
Market Cap vs. Volume: A weak negative correlation (-0.53) may indicate sporadic trading behavior.
The cryptocurrency's young age introduces volatility and uncertainty, limiting the reliability of long-term predictions.
**Future Directions**
On-Chain Metrics: Analyze blockchain data (e.g., transaction volume, active wallets) to understand user adoption and ecosystem growth.
Market Behavior Analysis: Study liquidity, order book dynamics, and trading pair performance for deeper insights into market efficiency.
Comparative Studies: Compare PEPU with other emerging cryptocurrencies to contextualize its performance and highlight opportunities.
Technologies Used
Python: Data manipulation and visualization.
**Libraries**:
pandas for managing datasets.
matplotlib and seaborn for creating charts and heatmaps.
